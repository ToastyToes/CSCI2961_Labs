- In my past experiences, even if I learned the answer from a friend, it is important to make sure I can do it on my own/get to
  the same conclusion. 
- In terms of asking questions, most stuff is online (like the article said) you just have to dig for it or break up the problem
- Another thing to do is broaden the search terms instead of being specific

It feels like Jeese was definetely in the right. He was using already made software, Microsofts file sharing, and just made it
easier to access within the already exisiting community. While it did promote pirating, pirating was already in place before this. If anything the NIAA should have sued Microsoft. Screw the NIAA. At least they changed the settlement from 1.5 mil to 12000. After learning about copyrights and licensing, I see how Jeese is also in the wrong..
