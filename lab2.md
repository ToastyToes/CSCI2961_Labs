1. It wouldnt let me start with 2.

2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
A license is important to keep others from inappropriately using your software/claiming it as their own or saying their messed up mod
is your fault. It allows you to specify how free you want your program to be and how other programs can interract with it. Depending on
the license you choose, the more restrictions or freedom you give to users. 

3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license 
If the software you are using is not licensed that means there can be restrictions that you are not aware about. (Not being able to see
the source code, not being able to use it with other programs, etc). Also, if they change the restrictions in an update and you are not
protected by the license, the update can affect everything you are doing. 

4. Do you agree with this claim?
